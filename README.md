# Assignment_for_mowito

We can simply run the 'Main_code' file in a Jupyter notebook to see the results.
Before running the code, we have to replace the paths for the template image and the test image in line 128 and 130.

The steps involved in the assignment to find the orientation of the object in the image are given in the 'Mowito_Assignment.pdf'.
